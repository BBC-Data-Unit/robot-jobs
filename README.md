In January 2018 we [reported on estimates that by 2030 nine areas could lose more than a quarter of jobs to automation and artificial intelligence (AI)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42810898).

The data came from a report by [The Centre for Cities](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664563/industrial-strategy-white-paper-web-ready-version.pdf), a copy of which is stored in this repo.
